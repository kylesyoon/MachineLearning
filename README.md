# Precision and Recall
Confusion Matrix
```
[TP FN]
[FP TN]
```

`Recall = True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)`
`Precision = True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive)`

# F1 Score
The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the prevision and recall. ([0, 1])
```
F1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
```

# R2 Score
Computed the coefficient of determination of predictions for true values.
The default scoring method for regression learners in scikit-learn.

# Explained Variance Score
